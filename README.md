# pktmasseta.github.io/frat | frat.mit.edu
## What is this?  
This is the "frat" subdomain of the PKT public website. frat.mit.edu directs to this subdomain via a CNAME record created by MIT IS&T.  

## What do I do with this?
The main use of this website is to provide a memorable MIT subdomain that redirects to PKT content.  This is especially useful for Rush and CPW when we promote events like Poker Night.  frat.mit.edu makes for a great website that can be chalked on the ground, or shared online to pub our materials.

## How do I change the content?
Edit the index.html file to deliver whatever content you desire.  This could be making a page to pub a party or event, or a redirect script that sends viewers to pkt.mit.edu or pkt.mit.edu/rush, or literally anything else you can think of.

Just make sure your changes are made in the gh-pages branch so that they are properly reflected.
